# Exploring Transcription Factor Binding with JASPAR: From PFMs to Deep Learning Models
JASPAR (https://jaspar.elixir.no/) is an open-access database that has provided high-quality, manually curated, and non-redundant DNA binding profiles for transcription factors (TFs) as position frequency matrices (PFMs) for over two decades. In this workshop, we will introduce participants to the latest updates to the CORE and UNVALIDATED collections, as well as the newly developed Deep Learning (DL) collection of JASPAR. The first part will cover the classical PFM-based collections, offering an overview of their structure, applications, and recent additions. The second part will focus on the Deep Learning collection, where participants will learn how to explore, download, and use DL models and derived motifs. Through guided hands-on exercises, we will demonstrate how to (i) scan sequences on the JASPAR website using DL-derived motifs, (ii) download DL models and related motif data, and (iii) perform model-based analyses using the tangermeme Python package (https://github.com/jmschrei/tangermeme). By the end of the session, attendees will gain both conceptual understanding and practical skills for integrating JASPAR resources into their bioinformatics research.
