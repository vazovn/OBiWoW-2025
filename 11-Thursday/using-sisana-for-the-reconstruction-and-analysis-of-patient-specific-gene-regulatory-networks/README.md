# Using SiSaNA for the reconstruction and analysis of patient-specific gene regulatory networks
Reconstructing gene regulatory networks is a common method in the field of bioinformatics for uncovering the transcriptional regulation driving patterns of disease. In these networks, some tools (such as PANDA and LIONESS) model the relationship between transcription factor and target genes. However, these tools are commonly not user-friendly, requiring a fair amount of prior programming experience to be able to reconstruct the networks and perform the downstream network.   Therefore, a new tool called SiSaNA (Single-Sample Network Analysis) was developed. SiSaNA allows users to reconstruct and analyze single-sample gene regulatory networks all via the command line, eliminating the need for prior programming experience.   Attendees will be worked through an example analysis that comes with the SiSaNA distribution, where we will preprocess input data, reconstruct networks, calculate critical network properties for identifying transcription factors and genes of interest, visualize these results, and identify biological pathways that are enriched in the sample groups.  More information on SiSaNA can be found at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/kuijjerlab/sisana/

## Instructions
We will have a brief presentation on gene regulatory networks and how SiSaNA works, then you will begin using SiSaNA to reconstruct single sample gene regulatory networks for individuals designated with the LumA or LumB subtype of breast cancer. We will then compare the regulation of genes between these subtypes. 

1. Follow the installation steps found on the SiSaNA GitHub repo: https://github.com/kuijjerlab/sisana
2. On the SiSaNA repo, work through the instructions in the README for running SiSaNA. Make sure to answer the questions as you go and we will discuss the answers at the end.
